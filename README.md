# BankGuard-AI
Our Solution: "BankGuard AI" - Multi-Modal Banking APK Authentication System A comprehensive detection system that combines visual analysis, static code analysis, and behavioral profiling to identify fake banking applications with 95%+ accuracy.
National CyberShield Hackathon 2025

🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Problem Statement: Detecting Fake Banking APKs
Challenge: Banks lose ₹1000+ crores annually to fake mobile banking applications that steal customer credentials and money.
Our Solution: "BankGuard AI" - Multi-Modal Banking APK Authentication System
A comprehensive detection system that combines visual analysis, static code analysis, and behavioral profiling to identify fake banking applications with 95%+ accuracy.

🚨 POLICE PERSPECTIVE - WHY THIS MATTERS
Real-World Impact:

Financial Loss: ₹1000+ crores lost annually to fake banking apps
Victim Count: 50,000+ citizens affected monthly
Investigation Challenge: Manual APK analysis takes 2-3 hours per case
Scale Problem: 500+ new fake banking apps appear daily across app stores

Current Police Challenges:

Manual Analysis Bottleneck: Cyber crime officers manually check each reported fake app
Technical Skill Gap: Limited mobile app forensics expertise in police force
Delayed Response: By the time fake apps are identified, thousands of users are affected
Evidence Collection: Difficulty in building court-admissible evidence against app developers

Our Solution Benefits for Police:

Automated Detection: Scan 1000+ APKs in 30 minutes vs 3 hours manual work
Evidence Generation: Auto-generated forensic reports for court proceedings
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous app store surveillance for new threats
Training Reduction: Simple dashboard interface requiring minimal technical training
Prevention Focus: Stop fake apps before they reach victims


💡 INNOVATIVE SOLUTION APPROACH
🔥 Innovation #1: Multi-Modal Fusion Detection
Problem: Traditional solutions only use static analysis (code checking)
Our Innovation: Combine 4 detection methods simultaneously

Visual Similarity: AI-powered icon and UI comparison
Static Analysis: Code structure and permission analysis
Dynamic Behavior: Runtime execution monitoring
Threat Intelligence: Real-time campaign correlation

Why This Wins: 95%+ accuracy vs 70% from single-method approaches
🔥 Innovation #2: Banking-Specific AI Models
Problem: Generic malware detectors miss banking-specific attack patterns
Our Innovation: Custom AI models trained specifically on banking app behaviors

Permission Anomaly Detection: Specialized rules for banking app permissions
UI Clone Detection: CNN models trained on legitimate banking app interfaces
Credential Harvesting Detection: Behavioral patterns specific to financial data theft

🔥 Innovation #3: Real-Time Threat Intelligence Integration
Problem: Static detection systems miss evolving threats
Our Innovation: Live threat intelligence feeds and campaign correlation

App Store Monitoring: Continuous scanning of multiple app stores
Campaign Clustering: Group related fake apps from same threat actor
Predictive Alerting: Warn about emerging fake app campaigns before widespread distribution

🔥 Innovation #4: Explainable AI for Legal Evidence
Problem: AI decisions are "black boxes" - unusable in court
Our Innovation: Full explainability and evidence chain generation

Decision Breakdown: Clear reasoning for each detection decision
Evidence Reports: Court-ready documentation with technical details
Chain of Custody: Complete audit trail for forensic investigations
